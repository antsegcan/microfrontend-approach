# Getting Started with MicroFrontends approach

In this repository I will show you how a React component can be made with Parcel and then deployed for MicroFrontend purposes.
With this approach you will be able to create your React components and use them wherever you want (does not matter the application) because your will build web components!


## Available Scripts

Once you have `npm install`ed the project, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!
